--> HTML and CSS part <--
1.Delete h1 - heading xx

2. Create a button of class sidebar-toggle inside of this button we will type i.fas.fa-bars that should create i tag with certain class --> this will make our button bounce xx

3. Next thing we must do is we have to create a sidebar tag  which has class of sidebar inside we have to create a div element we can do that with .sidebar-header. xx

4. Within this div we will create img tag in which src will be ./logo.svg and class logo xx

5. Bellow our logo but inside our div we want to put our button of class close-btn  in button we go with i.fas.fa-times.  xx

6. Next step we do is we copy html code from our utils.txt and paste it after div closing tag but inside our aside tag xx

7.Uncomment transform .sidebar css

    --> JS part <--
1. Elements that we want to select are: Our button with class .sidebar-toggle; another button with class .close-btn; the last one is our sidebar with class .sidebar xx

2. So we want to create 3 constant variables that will query sellect from classes that i talked in task above. Names of classes should be: toggleBtn, closeBtn, sidebar xx

3. For our toggle button, we want to add event listener on command click xx

4. inside of our function we will just check if our sidebar has class .show-sidebar /* check css if you can't remember */ xx

5. If it doesn't have show sidebar class we will add  .show-sidebar xx

6. If it does have show sidebar class we will remove .show-sidebar xx

7. We can do this with if/else and do if sidebar.classList.contains("show-sidebar") we will remove it else we will add it. xx

8. 2nd option is using toggle method. sidebar.classList.toggle("show-sidebar"); we will do it the first way. xx
9. We create for our close btn eventlistener inside body we will just use method to remove our sidebar-show class from our sidebar classes.
